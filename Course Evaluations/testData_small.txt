AS.362.325.01
The Role of "Place" in Racial Ethnic Health Disparities
Caryn Bell
Overall quality of the class: 4.73
Summary:
Students found this class to be engaging; Professor Bell encouraged students to discuss each concept
and how they related to the individual student. Students appreciated the small class size that facilitated
better and more thorough discussions. The topics covered were not only relevant to medicine and
public health, but also shed light on issues that these disciplines tend to overlook. The biggest
complaint about this class was that it covered too much information and it felt rushed to cover all the
material. Prior to taking this class, be advised the professor is a strict grader and assigns a lot of
homework.
AS.362.440.01
Oppression and Revolt
Floyd Hayes
Overall quality of the class: 4.69
Summary:
Students found this class to be challenging and rewarding. This discussion based class had engaging
readings and lectures. Students praised the professor's frequent and thought provoking commentary,
as well as his incorporation of current events into discussions of the assigned materials. The chief

complaints were that the class was not smaller, and that the professor had the tendency to go on
tangents that prevented more thorough analysis of the texts. Future students should understand they
will be challenged intellectually and academically in this class.
