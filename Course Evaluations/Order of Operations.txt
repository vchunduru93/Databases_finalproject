Order of Operations for inserting course evaluations:
1) Extract professor Fname and Lname and insert into PROFESSOR table (NOTE: do this only if professor does not already exist)
2) Query for PID from PROFESSOR table
3) Extract DNO, CNO, Semester, Year, Rating, Summary and insert along with PID into COURSE_INSTANCE table
4) Insert PID and DNO into DEPARTMENT_AFFILIATION table (NOTE: this can be done multiple times because some professors are cross-listed)
5) Extract Cname and insert along with DNO and CNO into COURSE table (NOTE: do this only if course does not already exist)
6) Extract Dname and insert along with DNO into DEPARTMENT table (NOTE: do this manually so as to simplify the process)
